# Image Encryption and Decryption App

This is a simple Python application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using the AES encryption algorithm. The app consists of two main files: `encripting.py` and `decripting.py`, which handle the encryption and decryption processes respectively.

## Requirements

To use this app, you need to have the following packages installed:

- Pillow (PIL)
- cryptography

You can install these packages by running the following command:

`pip install Pillow cryptography`


## Usage

To use the app, run the `main.py` file and follow the instructions:

python main.py`


You will be prompted to choose between encryption and decryption. If you choose encryption, you will be asked for the name of the PNG file you want to encrypt. The encrypted data will be saved in a binary file with the name you choose, along with a text file containing the encryption key.

If you choose decryption, you will be asked for the name of the binary file containing the encrypted data, as well as the name of the text file containing the encryption key. The decrypted image will be saved as a PNG file with the name you choose.


### manual usage
Note: Both `encripting.py` and `decripting.py` files can also be run separately if you prefer to encrypt/decrypt images without using the `main.py` file.
